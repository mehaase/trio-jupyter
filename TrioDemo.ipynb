    "\n",
    "* Doesn't work with synchronous Trio APIs (e.g. the `trio.current_time()` example above.)\n",
    "* Doesn't allow background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first point is inconvenient, but the second point is pretty much a deal-breaker. In `%autoawait trio` mode, Jupyter runs each cell inside of a new Trio event loop. This makes it impossible to spawn background tasks that keep running after a cell completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an especially poignant issue in Trio, because libraries may need to create background tasks as part of normal API functionality. For example, a WebSocket library may need a background task to read incoming network data. In `%autoawait trio` mode, the background task has to finish before a cell can complete, and therefore a connection created in one cell cannot be used in other cells!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the Trio kernel does not use `%autoawait trio`â€“in fact, trying to execute it will throw an exception."
